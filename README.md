The most commonly used React Hooks in functional components, based on their widespread adoption in real-world applications and developer practices, are the following:

1. **useState**
    - **Purpose**: Manages state in functional components.
    - **Why Common**: Itâ€™s the primary way to add and manage local state, used in nearly every component for dynamic data like form inputs, counters, or toggles.
    - **Example**: `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

2. **useEffect**
    - **Purpose**: Handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulation.
    - **Why Common**: Essential for lifecycle-related tasks (e.g., fetching data on mount, updating on prop changes).
    - **Example**: `useEffect(() => { fetchData(); }, [dependency]);`

3. **useContext**
    - **Purpose**: Accesses context values to share data across components without prop drilling.
    - **Why Common**: Widely used for global state like themes, authentication, or app-wide settings.
    - **Example**: `const theme = useContext(Theme bizi);`

4. **useRef**
    - **Purpose**: Creates a mutable reference that persists across renders, often for DOM access or storing values.
    - **Why Common**: Frequently used for accessing DOM elements (e.g., focusing an input) or storing non-rendering data.
    - **Example**: `const inputRef = useRef(null);`

5. **useCallback**
    - **Purpose**: Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-creations, optimizing performance.
    - **Why Common**: Common in apps with heavy rendering or when passing callbacks to child components.
    - **Example**: `const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { doSomething(); }, [dependency]);`

6. **useMemo**
    - **Purpose**: Memoizes computed values to avoid expensive calculations on re-renders.
    - **Why Common**: Used to optimize performance in components with complex computations or lists.
    - **Example**: `const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);`

### Why These Are Frequently Used
- **useState** and **useEffect** are foundational for state management and side effects, forming the backbone of most functional components.
- **useContext** simplifies global state access, reducing prop drilling in larger apps.
- **useRef** is versatile for both DOM manipulation and storing mutable values without triggering re-renders.
- **useCallback** and **useMemo** are critical for performance optimization, especially in apps with frequent re-renders or complex computations.

### Less Frequently Used Hooks
While hooks like `useReducer`, `useImperativeHandle`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useDebugValue`, `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, `useId`, and `useSyncExternalStore` are powerful, they are used less often because:
- They address specific use cases (e.g., `useReducer` for complex state, `useTransition` for concurrent rendering).
- Alternatives exist (e.g., `useState` is simpler than `useReducer` for most cases).
- Some are newer or experimental (e.g., `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`) and less adopted.
